# WindowsHighlightChanger
C# Application which allows for easy changing of your Windows selection highlight

I couldn't find an app/program that automates this process, so I decided to write one.
It's not very well written obviously, it works though and didn't break my PC or VM.

Once you've applied your changes via the APPLY button then you'll need to restart your pc for changes to take effect Lol!

### Bad comparison
